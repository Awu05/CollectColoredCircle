# CollectColoredCircle

This is a simple Swift game made using Spritekit. 

This is a simple game that you just tap on the screen for 5 seconds
and it will spawn random circles on the screen and once the 4 seconds are over,
you will have 5 seconds to collect as many orange circles that spawned as you can.
